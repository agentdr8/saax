# Sensible Android Auto:Xposed

Xposed module for [Android Auto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.projection.gearhead) app to make the interface restrictions configurable

Because Android Auto is integrated into certain vehicles, Google either felt the need to, or regulations required that they build in some driver distraction protections into Android Auto.
Unfortunately, some of these restrictions just add to driver frustration, and prompt one to disconnect the phone from AA and fiddle with it directly. This too is a distraction, and one
that I believe outweighs the inability to scroll lists while in motion. 

This module will allow the end user to adjust how many screen taps are allowed total while in motion before the restriction screen shows up, in addition to setting the maximum speed 
before the screen tap limit kicks in.

As a reminder, I'm not responsible for anything that happens as a result of using this module. If you're not capable of doing more than one task at a time while driving, I *HIGHLY* suggest
you not install this module.
